<p>Robert Mars is transforming the visual landscape of the American 1950s and 60s popular culture into a visually striking and modernized narrative. Mars keeps the icons alive by using symbols, magazine headlines, signs and graphics from that era- giving nods to the instantly recognizable Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley, and others that scream “America” within the confines of his canvas.</p>

<p>With a vibrant color palette, and his layers of muscle cars, motel signs, and American flags, he illustrates the personality of the country in its great and hopeful glory. His paintings evoke a deep nostalgia for a time before technology. A time when there was still a sense of mystery to the world, and everything couldn’t be discovered with just a few clicks of a mouse.</p>

<p>We got in touch with Robert to find out a little more about his work, process, and who he calls his single greatest inspiration.</p>

<p>To start things off, how long have you been making art and collages? Were you into it as a kid?</p>
<p>I have been making art as long as I can remember. A few years back my parents gave me some artwork that I had done between 5 and 10 years old and I was surprised to see that I was already experimenting with collage and pop based themes. No one in my family was artistic so I am not sure where the influence came from. The thought to switch my career from a graphic design focus to fine art came in 2000 when I started to get burnt on graphics and felt that I had a story to convey that I was not able to tell through graphic design.</p>

				<p>In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
